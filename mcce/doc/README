+  In step2, use relative vdw energy for the conformer vdw prune

+  don't add the above to mcce2.5, need more tests.
+  now depth, only consider delphi, so apbs has the same del_run
   since only use the delphi_grid
   need to add apbs_grid later, although they are the same now.

+  split vdw and ele pairwise interaction from residues in mfe
+  corect the random number generate problem in h optimization
+  corect the the hydroxyl optimization which actually not be done before (torsion problem)
+  always read the head1.lst for step2, it's better for the quick gold run
+  output the pdb file and headlist of each rotamer making step in directory "rot"
+  use env.s2_vdw to scale the vdw energy in step2 including:
     sas term in get_vdw0.c
     vdw      in vdw_conf_fast in vdw_fast.c for vdw0, vdw1
     vdw      in Evdw_conf2conf for over_vdw (pruning)
     vdw      in vdw_conf in vdw_conf.c for the relaxation
